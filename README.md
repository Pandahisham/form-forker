#Form forking
Handle forks in the road (form) based on user input.


##Branching Methods
You can branch your form by evaluating strings or integers. Both of the following methods take two arguments. The child branches that are dependent on this evaluation, and the value entered by the user.

**integerEval** `formObject.integerEval(childBranches, userEnteredValue)`

**stringEval** `formObject.stringEval(childBranches, userEnteredValue)`
